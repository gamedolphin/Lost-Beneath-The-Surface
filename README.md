Lost-Beneath-The-Surface
========================

LD #29 Entry with theme "Beneath The Surface" - You're a firefly lost in the dark, beneath the surface and must find a way out of the mazes created by the horrors in the dark

Colliding with a horror without wearing a helmet is instant death. You can find helmets strewn around the maze.

Each maze is larger than the last one and is created randomly. Maze generation algorithm is not mine.

Made using the Phaser framework. <3
